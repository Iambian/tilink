1. default line state is high (1) of open drain/collector type (e.g. i2c)
2. red wire is tip (red in our impl.), white wire is ring (yellow in our impl.)
3. Let pin 0 be tip, pin 1 be ring.

lsbit xmitted and received first. 

TRANSMIT:

xmitstart:
- Read bit from FIFO (stall here if empty)
- If input bit is 1: goto xmit1start
xmit0start:
- Set P0 to 0
- Wait until P1 becomes 0
- Set P0 to 1
- Wait until P1 becomes 1
- Goto xmitstart
xmit1start:
- Set P1 to 0
- Wait until P0 becomes 0
- Set P1 to 1
- Wait until P0 becomes 1
- Goto xmitstart

RECEIVE:

recvstart:
- If P0 and P1 are low: error condition
- If P0 and P1 are high: goto recvstart
- If P1 is low: goto recv1start

recv0start: (P0 was low)
- Write 0 to FIFO
- Reset P1 (P1 becomes 0)
- Wait until P0 becomes 1
- Set P1 (P1 becomes 1)
- Goto recvstart

recv1start: (P1 was low)
- Write 1 to FIFO
- Reset P0 (P0 becomes 0)
- Wait until P1 becomes 1
- Set P0 (P1 becomes 1)
- Goto recvstart

errorcond:
- Reset FIFO
- Goto recvstart
