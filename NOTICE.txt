This project really should be in C since that's how I'm supposed to
implement the USB drivers needed to meet the end goal of presenting
a TI calculator to a computer as an MTP device for ease of variable
transfer.

At the moment, testing will be done in Python since that permits
faster turnaround during testing. Gotta make sure the basics work.
