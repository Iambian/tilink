TI Graphing Calculator Serial Link Protocol as Implemented on a Raspberry Pi Pico
=================================================================================

Nothing very usable here yet. Might as well put a TODO list here so I can keep
track of progress and remember what needs to happen to reach my end goal.

TODO
----

* Get directory listing from calc and parse its contents
* Support silent variable requests
* Think of other protocol doodads that I might need to support
* Rewrite this whole thing in C so I can do the TinyUSB thing to make my RPI into an MTP device
* ???
* PROFIT

Special Thanks

* The guy who wrote the TI link guide
